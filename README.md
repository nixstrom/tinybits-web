## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This is a personal site of Nikki StrÃ¸msnes, which is me. The site was first registered October 7 2010, then completely rebuilt in 2020. While it visually hasn't changed much in those ten years, it is now set up properly in a proper stack and in a CI/CD pipeline.

Gone are the days of manually dragging folders over FTP!

This allows me to iterate on it a little more efficiently. One day, I will introduce a blog so I can share some of my mad ramblings, but for now we will keep it simple, keep it cool.

## ðŸš€ Tech stack

This is a statically rendered React + Gatsby project, based on [Gatsby Starter Default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and modified beyond recognition. It uses CSS Modules for styling ... and is otherwise lean as a leopard.
